## Locale Storage and Cookies

- Ask user to input their name and display it on the page. Store this value to local storage and so it can be displayed if they visit again. Allow them to change it.

- Have two input boxes, one for _value_ one for _key_. Take these two values together and store it in locale storage. STRETCH: display everything in locale storage as a list.

## DOM Manipulation

- Have an text input box. Take the value input by the user and display it on the page with _Dom methods only_. Have a button that allows them to delete the last item they added.

## Geolocation

- Ask the user their location. If they accept display their co-ordinates on the page (STRETCH: Display this on a MAP) but if they reject show a message indicating this ('Sorry could not find your location")

## Canvas

- Create a drawing canvas where the user can draw with a mouse over event. Have a button to clear the canvas completely. STRETCH: Allow the user to choose different colors as they draw

## API

- Find any API (e.g. https://api.thecatapi.com/) and make a FETCH request to it using _xhttp_
